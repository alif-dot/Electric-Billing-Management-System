# Electric-Billing-Management-System
An Electric Billing Management System is a software that helps utility companies to manage the billing and payment process for their customers. A SQL database can be used to store and manage the data used by the system.

In a case study, a utility company has decided to develop an Electric Billing Management System and has chosen to use a SQL database to store and manage the data. The system will have several functionalities such as:

•	Customer management: storing customer details such as name, contact information, and billing history.
•	Meter management: storing information about meters such as location, serial number, and meter readings. 
•	Billing management: generating and storing bills for customers based on meter readings and tariffs. 
•	Payment management: storing information about payments such as payment date, amount, and method of payment. 
•	Employee management: storing information about employees such as name, contact information, and role within the company.

To implement these functionalities, the following SQL tables would be created:
•	Customers: to store customer details. 
•	Meters: to store information about meters. 
•	Billing: to store information about bills. 
•	Payments: to store information about payments. 
•	Employees: to store information about employees.

In addition, relationships between the tables would be established using foreign keys to ensure data consistency and integrity. For example, the Billing table would have a foreign key referencing the Customers table and the Meters table to indicate which customer is being billed and for which meter readings.
The system would be designed to support various queries such as generating reports on customer billing history, meter performance, and employee performance.
Overall, the system would use a SQL database to store and manage data, allowing the utility company to efficiently manage the billing process and make data-driven decisions.
